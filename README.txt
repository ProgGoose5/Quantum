Quantum, its a file manager meant to be similar to dolphin but using a Text User Interface.
My main objetive is to push myself as far I can before starting to use GUIs. 
As Goosey, this will be build almost completly in C.

$ cd ~/Quantum && mkdir build

$ cd ~/Quantum/build && cmake .. 

$ make
